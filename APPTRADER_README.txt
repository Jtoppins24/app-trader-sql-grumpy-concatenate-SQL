# Intro 

App Trader is a targeted data analysis project aiming to assess a business case and make a recommendation. In this case, analysts were grouped together to analyze a database of different phone apps and their key metrics, determine the most profitable app investments, then pitch 10 apps to stakeholders. This project required advanced SQL (PostgreSQL) queries as the foundation for the app recommendations; key skills included: Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, casting, and aggregations.
